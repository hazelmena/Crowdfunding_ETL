# Crowdfunding-ETL
This repository contains an example of Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) skills applied to a large dataset using Python and SQL. The project focuses on migrating data from Excel files to a PostgreSQL database. The data is processed and stored to support further analysis by the analytics team, which will generate reports for company stakeholders and project donors.

## Overview
In this project, SQL queries were executed on behalf of "Independent Funding," a crowdfunding platform for supporting independent projects and ventures. The main objective was to migrate data from Excel files into a PostgreSQL database. This data migration sets the foundation for future analysis and reporting.

## Summary
Utilizing Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and PostgreSQL, the following tasks were accomplished:

1. **Data Extraction and Transformation:**
   - Data was extracted from a large Excel file and transformed into smaller, manageable CSV files.

2. **Database Setup:**
   - A PostgreSQL database was created, and appropriate tables were established based on an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).

3. **Data Loading:**
   - The transformed CSV files were loaded into the PostgreSQL database, ensuring data integrity.

4. **Querying and Reporting:**
   - SQL queries were executed to retrieve and process data. These results will be used to generate reports for stakeholders, including company executives and project donors.

This project serves as a practical example of ETL processes and their significance in managing and analyzing large datasets. The resulting database will facilitate data-driven decision-making and reporting for "Independent Funding."
